<p>Robert Johnson was an essentially commonplace man, with no feature to
distinguish him from a million others. He was pale of face, ordinary in
looks, neutral in opinions, thirty years of age, and a married man. By
trade he was a gentleman’s outfitter in the New North Road, and the
competition of business squeezed out of him the little character that
was left. In his hope of conciliating customers, he had become cringing
and pliable, until working ever in the same routine from day to day, he
seemed to have sunk into a soulless machine rather than a man. No great
question had ever stirred him. At the end of this snug century,
self-contained in his own narrow circle, it seemed impossible that any
of the mighty, primitive passions of mankind could ever reach him. Yet
birth, and lust, and illness, and death are changeless things, and when
one of these harsh facts springs out upon a man at some sudden turn of
the path of life, it dashes off for the moment his mask of civilization
and gives a glimpse of the stranger and stronger face below.</p>

<p>Johnson’s wife was a quiet little woman, with brown hair and gentle
ways. His affection for her was the one positive trait in his character.
Together they would lay out the shop window every Monday morning, the
spotless shirts in their green cardboard boxes below, the neckties above
hung in rows over the brass rails, the cheap studs glistening from the
white cards at either side, while in the background were the rows of
cloth caps and the bank of boxes in which the more valuable hats were
screened from the sunlight. She kept the books and sent out the bills.
No one but she knew the joys and sorrows which crept into his small
life. She had shared his exultations when the gentleman who was going to
India had bought ten dozen shirts and an incredible number of collars,
and she had been as stricken as he when, after the goods had gone, the
bill was returned from the hotel address with the information that no
such person had lodged there. For five years they had worked, building
up the business, thrown together all the more closely because their
marriage had been a childless one. Now, however, there were signs that a
change was at hand, and that speedily. She was unable to come
downstairs, and her mother, Mrs. Peyton, came over from Camberwell to
nurse her and to welcome her grandchild.</p>

<p>Little qualms of anxiety came over Johnson as his wife’s time
approached. However, after all, it was a natural process. Other men’s
wives went through it unharmed, and why should not his? He was himself
one of a family of fourteen, and yet his mother was alive and hearty. It
was quite the exception for anything to go wrong. And yet in spite of
his reasonings the remembrance of his wife’s condition was always like a
somber background to all his other thoughts.</p>

<p>Doctor Miles of Bridport Place, the best man in the neighborhood, was
retained five months in advance, and, as time stole on, many little
packages of absurdly small white garments with frill work and ribbons
began to arrive among the big consignments of male necessities. And then
one evening, as Johnson was ticketing the scarfs in the shop, he heard a
bustle upstairs, and Mrs. Peyton came running down to say that Lucy was
bad and that she thought the doctor ought to be there without delay.</p>

<p>It was not Robert Johnson’s nature to hurry. He was prim and staid
and liked to do things in an orderly fashion. It was a quarter of a mile
from the corner of the New North Road where his shop stood to the
doctor’s house in Bridport Place. There were no cabs in sight so he set
off upon foot, leaving the lad to mind the shop. At Bridport Place he
was told that the doctor had just gone to Harman Street to attend a man
in a fit. Johnson started off for Harman Street, losing a little of his
primness as he became more anxious. Two full cabs but no empty ones
passed him on the way. At Harman Street he learned that the doctor had
gone on to a case of measles; fortunately he had left the address—69
Dunstan Road, at the other side of the Regent’s Canal. Robert’s primness
had vanished now as he thought of the women waiting at home, and he
began to run as hard as he could down the Kingsland Road. Some way along
he sprang into a cab which stood by the curb and drove to Dunstan Road.
The doctor had just left, and Robert Johnson felt inclined to sit down
upon the steps in despair.</p>

<p>Fortunately he had not sent the cab away, and he was soon back at
Bridport Place. Doctor Miles had not returned yet, but they were
expecting him every instant. Johnson waited, drumming his fingers on his
knees, in a high, dim-lit room, the air of which was charged with a
faint, sickly smell of ether. The furniture was massive, and the books
in the shelves were somber, and a squat, black clock ticked mournfully
on the mantelpiece. It told him that it was half-past seven, and that he
had been gone an hour and a quarter. Whatever would the women think of
him! Every time that a distant door slammed he sprang from his chair in
a quiver of eagerness. His ears strained to catch the deep notes of the
doctor’s voice. And then, suddenly, with a gush of joy he heard a quick
step outside, and the sharp click of the key in the lock. In an instant
he was out in the hall, before the doctor’s foot was over the
threshold.</p>

<p>“If you please, doctor, I’ve come for you,” he cried; “the wife was
taken bad at six o’clock.”</p>

<p>He hardly knew what he expected the doctor to do. Something very
energetic, certainly—to seize some drugs, perhaps, and rush excitedly
with him through the gaslit streets. Instead of that Doctor Miles threw
his umbrella into the rack, jerked off his hat with a somewhat peevish
gesture, and pushed Johnson back into the room.</p>

<p>“Let’s see! You <i>did</i> engage me, didn’t you?” he asked in no very
cordial voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, doctor, last November. Johnson the outfitter, you know, in
the New North Road.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. It’s a bit overdue,” said the doctor, glancing at a list
of names in a note book with a very shiny cover. “Well, how is she?”</p>

<p>“I don’t——”</p>

<p>“Ah, of course, it’s your first. You’ll know more about it next
time.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Peyton said it was time you were there, sir.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir, there can be no very pressing hurry in a first case. We
shall have an all-night affair, I fancy. You can’t get an engine to go
without coals, Mr. Johnson, and I have had nothing but a light
lunch.”</p>

<p>“We could have something cooked for you—something hot and a cup of
tea.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, but I fancy my dinner is actually on the table. I can do
no good in the earlier stages. Go home and say that you have seen me and
that I am coming, and I will be round immediately afterwards.”</p>

<p>A sort of horror filled Robert Johnson as he gazed at this man who
could think about his dinner at such a moment. He had not imagination
enough to realize that the experience which seemed so appallingly
important to him, was the merest everyday matter of business to the
medical nun who could not have lived for a year had he not, amid the
rush of work, remembered what was due to his own health. To Johnson he
seemed little better than a monster. His thoughts were bitter as he sped
back to his shop.</p>

<p>“You’ve taken your time,” said his mother-in-law reproachfully,
looking down the stairs as he entered.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t help it!” he gasped. “Is it over?”</p>

<p>“Over! She’s got to be worse, poor dear, before she can be better.
Where’s Doctor Miles?”</p>

<p>“He’s coming after he’s had dinner.”</p>

<p>The old woman was about to make some reply, when, from the
half-opened door behind, a high, whinnying voice cried out for her. She
ran back and closed the door, while Johnson, sick at heart, turned into
the shop. There he sent the lad home and busied himself frantically in
putting up shutters and turning out boxes. When all was closed and
finished he seated himself in the parlor behind the shop. But he could
not sit still. He rose incessantly to walk a few paces and then fell
back into a chair once more. Suddenly the clatter of china fell upon his
ear, and he saw the maid pass the door with a cup on a tray and a
smoking teapot.</p>

<p>“Who is that for, Jane?” he asked.</p>

<p>“For the mistress, Mr. Johnson. She says she would fancy it.”</p>

<p>There was immeasurable consolation to him in that homely cup of tea.
It wasn’t so very bad after all if his wife could think of such things.
So lighthearted was he that he asked for a cup also. He had just
finished it when the doctor arrived, with a small black leather bag in
his hand.</p>

<p>“Well, how is she?” he asked genially.</p>

<p>“Oh, she’s very much better,” said Johnson, with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“Dear me, that’s bad!” said the doctor. “Perhaps it will do if I look
in on my morning round?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” cried Johnson, clutching at his thick frieze overcoat. “We
are so glad that you have come. And, doctor, please come down soon and
let me know what you think about it.”</p>

<p>The doctor passed upstairs, his firm, heavy steps resounding through
the house. Johnson could hear his boots creaking as he walked about the
floor above him, and the sound was a consolation to him. It was crisp
and decided, the tread of a man who had plenty of self-confidence.
Presently, still straining his ears to catch what was going on, he heard
the scraping of a chair as it was drawn along the floor, and a moment
later he heard the door fly open and some one come rushing downstairs.
Johnson sprang up with his hair bristling, thinking that some dreadful
thing had occurred, but it was only his mother-in-law, incoherent with
excitement and searching for scissors and some tape. She vanished again
and Jane passed up the stairs with a pile of newly aired linen. Then,
after an interval of silence, Johnson heard the heavy, creaking tread
and the doctor came down into the parlor.</p>

<p>“That’s better,” said he, pausing with his hand upon the door. “You
look pale, Mr. Johnson.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir, not at all,” he answered deprecatingly, mopping his
brow with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“There is no immediate cause for alarm,” said Doctor Miles. “The case
is not all that we could wish it. Still we will hope for the best.”</p>

<p>“Is there danger, sir?” gasped Johnson.</p>

<p>“Well, there is always danger, of course. It is not altogether a
favorable case, but still it might be much worse. I have given her a
draught. I saw as I passed that they have been doing a little building
opposite to you. It’s an improving quarter. The rents go higher and
higher. You have a lease of your own little place, eh?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, yes!” cried Johnson, whose ears were straining for every
sound from above, and who felt none the less that it was very soothing
that the doctor should be able to chat so easily at such a time. “That’s
to say, no, sir, I am a yearly tenant.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I should get a lease if I were you. There’s Marshall, the
watchmaker, down the street. I attended his wife twice and saw him
through the typhoid when they took up the drains in Prince Street. I
assure you his landlord sprung his rent nearly forty a year and he had
to pay or clear out.”</p>

<p>“Did his wife get through it, doctor?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, she did very well. Hullo! Hullo!”</p>

<p>He slanted his ear to the ceiling with a questioning face, and then
darted swiftly from the room.</p>

<p>It was March and the evenings were chill, so Jane had lit the fire,
but the wind drove the smoke downwards and the air was full of its acrid
taint. Johnson felt chilled to the bone, though rather by his
apprehensions than by the weather. He crouched over the fire with his
thin, white hands held out to the blaze. At ten o’clock Jane brought in
the joint of cold meat and laid his place for supper, but he could not
bring himself to touch it. He drank a glass of the beer, however, and
felt the better for it. The tension of his nerves seemed to have reacted
upon his hearing, and he was able to follow the most trivial things in
the room above. Once, when the beer was still heartening him, he nerved
himself to creep on tiptoe up the stair and to listen to what was going
on. The bedroom door was half an inch open, and through the slit he
could catch a glimpse of the clean-shaven face of the doctor, looking
wearier and more anxious than before. Then he rushed downstairs like a
lunatic, and running to the door he tried to distract his thoughts by
watching what was going on in the street. The shops were all shut, and
some rollicking boon companions came shouting along from the public
house. He stayed at the door until the stragglers had thinned down, and
then came back to his seat by the fire. In his dim brain he was asking
himself questions which had never intruded themselves before. Where was
the justice of it? What had his sweet, innocent little wife done that
she should be used so? Why was nature so cruel? He was frightened at his
own thoughts, and yet wondered that they had never occurred to him
before.</p>

<p>As the early morning drew in, Johnson, sick at heart and shivering in
every limb, sat with his great coat huddled round him, staring at the
gray ashes and waiting hopelessly for some relief. His face was white
and clammy, and his nerves had been numbed into a half-conscious state
by the long monotony of misery. But suddenly all his feelings leaped
into keen life again as he heard the bedroom door open and the doctor’s
steps upon the stair. Robert Johnson was precise and unemotional in
everyday life, but he almost shrieked now as he rushed forward to know
if it were over.</p>

<p>One glance at the stern, drawn face which met him showed that it was
no pleasant news which had sent the doctor downstairs. His appearance
had altered as much as Johnson’s during the last few hours. His hair was
on end, his face flushed, his forehead dotted with beads of
perspiration. There was a peculiar fierceness in his eye, and about the
lines of his mouth, a fighting look as befitted a man who for hours on
end had been striving with the hungriest of foes for the most precious
of prizes. But there was a sadness, too, as though his grim opponent had
been overmastering him. He sat down and leaned his head upon his hand
like a man who is fagged out.</p>

<p>“I thought it my duty to see you, Mr. Johnson, and to tell you that
it is a very nasty case. Your wife’s heart is not strong, and she has
some symptoms which I do not like. What I wanted to say is that if you
would like to have a second opinion I shall be very glad to meet any one
whom you might suggest.”</p>

<p>Johnson was so dazed by his want of sleep and the evil news that he
could hardly grasp the doctor’s meaning. The other, seeing him hesitate,
thought that he was considering the expense.</p>

<p>“Smith or Hawley would come for two guineas,” said he. “But I think
Pritchard of the City Road is the best man.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, bring the best man,” cried Johnson.</p>

<p>“Pritchard would want three guineas. He is a senior man, you
see.”</p>

<p>“I’d give him all I have if he would pull her through. Shall I run
for him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Go to my house first and ask for the green baize bag. The
assistant will give it to you. Tell him I want the A. C. E. mixture. Her
heart is too weak for chloroform. Then go for Pritchard and bring him
back with you.”</p>

<p>It was heavenly for Johnson to have something to do and to feel that
he was of some use to his wife. He ran swiftly to Bridport Place, his
footfalls clattering through the silent streets and the big, dark
policemen turning their yellow funnels of light on him as he passed. Two
tugs at the night bell brought down a sleepy, half-clad assistant, who
handed him a stoppered glass bottle and a cloth hag which contained
something which clinked when you moved it. Johnson thrust the bottle
into his pocket, seized the green bag, and pressing his hat firmly down
ran as hard as he could set foot to ground until he was in the City Road
and saw the name of Pritchard engraved in white upon a red ground. He
bounded in triumph up the three steps which led to the door, and as he
did so there was a crash behind him. His precious bottle was in
fragments upon the pavement.</p>

<p>For a moment he felt as if it were his wife’s body that was lying
there. But the run had freshened his wits and he saw that the mischief
might be repaired. He pulled vigorously at the night bell.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter?” asked a gruff voice at his elbow. He
started back and looked up at the windows, but there was no sign of
life. He was approaching the bell again with the intention of pulling
it, when a perfect roar burst from the wall.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand shivering here all night,” cried the voice. “Say who
you are and what you want or I shut the tube.”</p>

<p>Then for the first time Johnson saw that the end of a speaking tube
hung out of the wall just above the bell. He shouted up it:</p>

<p>“I want you to come with me to meet Doctor Miles at a confinement at
once.”</p>

<p>“How far?” shrieked the irascible voice.</p>

<p>“The New North Road, Hoxton.”</p>

<p>“My consultation fee is three guineas, payable at the time.”</p>

<p>“All right,” shouted Johnson. “You are to bring a bottle of A. C. E.
mixture with you.”</p>

<p>“All right! Wait a bit!”</p>

<p>Five minutes later an elderly, hard-faced man, with grizzled hair,
flung open the door. As he emerged a voice from somewhere in the shadows
cried:</p>

<p>“Mind you take your cravat, John,” and he impatiently growled
something over his shoulder in reply.</p>

<p>The consultant was a man who had been hardened by a life of ceaseless
labor, and who had been driven, as so many others have been, by the
needs of his own increasing family to set the commercial before the
philanthropic side of his profession. Yet beneath his rough crust he was
a man with a kindly heart.</p>

<p>“We don’t want to break a record,” said he, pulling up and panting
after attempting to keep up with Johnson for five minutes. “I would go
quicker if I could, my dear sir, and I quite sympathize with your
anxiety, but really I can’t manage it.”</p>

<p>So Johnson, on fire with impatience, had to slow down until they
reached the New North Road, when he ran ahead and had the door open for
the doctor when he came. He heard the two meet outside the bedroom, and
caught scraps of their conversation. “Sorry to knock you up—nasty
case—decent people.” Then it sank into a mumble and the door closed
behind them.</p>

<p>Johnson sat up in his chair now, listening keenly, for he knew that a
crisis must be at hand. He heard the two doctors moving about, and was
able to distinguish the step of Pritchard, which had a drag in it, from
the clean, crisp sound of the other’s footfall. There was silence for a
few minutes and then a curious, drunken, mumbling, sing-song voice came
quavering up, very unlike anything which he had heard hitherto. At the
same time a sweetish, insidious scent, imperceptible perhaps to any
nerves less strained than his, crept down the stairs and penetrated into
the room. The voice dwindled into a mere drone and finally sank away
into silence, and Johnson gave a long sigh of relief, for he knew that
the drug had done its work and that, come what might, there should be no
more pain for the sufferer.</p>

<p>But soon the silence became even more trying to him than the cries
had been. He had no clew now as to what was going on, and his mind
swarmed with horrible possibilities. He rose and went to the bottom of
the stairs again. He heard the clink of metal against metal, and the
subdued murmur of the doctors’ voices. Then he heard Mrs. Peyton say
something, in a tone as of fear or expostulation, and again the doctors
murmured together. For twenty minutes he stood there leaning against the
wall, listening to the occasional rumbles of talk without being able to
catch a word of it. And then of a sudden there rose out of the silence
the strangest little piping cry, and Mrs. Peyton screamed out in her
delight and the man ran into the parlor and flung himself down upon the
horsehair sofa, drumming his heels on it in his ecstasy.</p>

<p>But often the great cat Fate lets us go only to clutch us again in a
fiercer grip. As minute after minute passed and still no sound came from
above save those thin, glutinous cries, Johnson cooled from his frenzy
of joy, and lay breathless with his ears straining. They were moving
slowly about. They were talking in subdued tones. Still minute after
minute passed, and no word from the voice for which he listened. His
nerves were dulled by his night of trouble, and he waited in limp
wretchedness upon his sofa. There he still sat when the doctors came
down to him—a bedraggled, miserable figure with his face grimy and his
hair unkempt from his long vigil. He rose as they entered, bracing
himself against the mantelpiece.</p>

<p>“Is she dead?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Doing well,” answered the doctor.</p>

<p>And at the words that little conventional spirit which had never
known until that night the capacity for fierce agony which lay within
it, learned for the second time that there were springs of joy also
which it had never tapped before. His impulse was to fall upon his
knees, but he was shy before the doctors.</p>

<p>“Can I go up?”</p>

<p>“In a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure, doctor, I’m very—I’m very——” He grew inarticulate.</p>

<p>“Here are your three guineas, Doctor Pritchard. I wish they were
three hundred.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” said the senior man, and they laughed as they shook
hands.</p>

<p>Johnson opened the shop door for them and heard their talk as they
stood for an instant outside.</p>

<p>“Looked nasty at one time.”</p>

<p>“Very glad to have your help.”</p>

<p>“Delighted, I’m sure. Won’t you step round and have a cup of
coffee?”</p>

<p>“No, thanks. I’m expecting another case.”</p>

<p>The firm step and the dragging one passed away to the right and the
left. Johnson turned from the door still with that turmoil of joy in his
heart. He seemed to be making a new start in life. He felt that he was a
stronger and a deeper man. Perhaps all this suffering had an object,
then. It might prove to be a blessing both to his wife and to him. The
very thought was one which he would have been incapable of conceiving
twelve hours before. He was full of new emotions. If there had been a
harrowing, there had been a planting, too.</p>

<p>“Can I come up?” he cried, and then, without waiting for an answer,
he took the steps three at a time.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peyton was standing by a soapy bath with a bundle in her hands.
From under the curve of a brown shawl there looked out at him the
strangest little red face with crumpled features, moist loose lips, and
eyelids which quivered like a rabbit’s nostrils. The weak neck had let
the head topple over, and it rested upon the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Kiss it, Robert!” cried the grandmother. “Kiss your son!”</p>

<p>But he felt a resentment to the little, red, blinking creature. He
could not forgive it yet for that long night of misery. He caught sight
of a white face in the bed and he ran toward it with such love and pity
as his speech could find no words for.</p>

<p>“Thank God it is over! Lucy, dear, it was dreadful!”</p>

<p>“But I’m so happy now. I never was so happy in my life.”</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed upon the brown bundle.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t talk,” said Mrs. Peyton.</p>

<p>“But don’t leave me,” whispered his wife.</p>

<p>So he sat in silence with his hand in hers. The lamp was burning dim
and the first cold light of dawn was breaking through the window. The
night had been long and dark but the day was the sweeter and the purer
in consequence. London was waking up. The roar began to rise from the
street. Lives had come and lives had gone, but the great machine was
still working out its dim and tragic destiny.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
